//! Async child processes on a [`Runtime`].
//!
//! The API has the shape of [`std::process`], like `smol::process`. A [`Command`] builds the
//! process to spawn. The [`Child`] it spawns holds the pipes to the process, [`ChildStdin`],
//! [`ChildStdout`] and [`ChildStderr`], and has futures that wait for the process to exit. Nothing
//! here blocks the thread: when an operation has to wait, the thread can run other tasks.
//!
//! The pipes implement the `AsyncWrite` and `AsyncRead` traits of [`futures-io`], so the extension
//! traits of [`futures`] work on them.
//!
//! # The runtime
//!
//! A child is spawned on a runtime, which [`Command::spawn`], [`Command::status`] and
//! [`Command::output`] take as an argument.
//!
//! On unix, the runtime's reactor watches the pipes to the child. Reads and writes make progress
//! while a thread is running [`Runtime::block_on`] on that runtime. They also make progress while
//! the helper thread runs the runtime, as it does for one from `SharedRuntime::current`. On Linux
//! (with pidfd support), on Apple's platforms and on the BSDs, the reactor also watches for the
//! process to exit, so a wait for the exit makes progress in the same way.
//!
//! On Windows, the reactor cannot watch a pipe. Each read from and write to a pipe runs as blocking
//! work on a thread of the pool of [`unblock()`](crate::unblock()), so it makes progress even
//! while no thread is running `block_on`. The same holds for a wait for the exit on any platform
//! where the reactor cannot watch for it, which includes Windows. That wait runs on a pool of its
//! own: see [waiting for a child](self#waiting-for-a-child).
//!
//! `Child` and the pipes are generic over the runtime's flavour, on every platform. A child spawned
//! on a [`LocalRuntime`] is a `Child<Local>` (`Local` is the default). It stays on the thread that
//! created it, with its pipes. A child spawned on a [`SharedRuntime`] is a `Child<Shared>`, which
//! can be sent to and used from any thread.
//!
//! # Waiting for a child
//!
//! [`Child::status`] waits for the process to exit and resolves to its exit status.
//! [`Child::output`] does the same after it has read the output pipes.
//!
//! On unix, a process that has exited stays in the process table as a zombie, and keeps its
//! process ID, until its status is collected. [`Child::status`] collects the status when it
//! resolves, and so does [`Child::try_status`], which never waits.
//!
//! If the runtime can watch for the exit, the wait holds no thread:
//!
//! - On Linux, the runtime watches a pidfd, a descriptor of the process that becomes readable when
//!   the process exits.
//! - On Apple's platforms and the BSDs, it watches a kqueue that belongs to the child alone, with a
//!   filter on the process. The descriptor of the queue becomes readable when the process exits.
//!
//! The reactor watches the descriptor like a pipe, from the spawn until it reports the exit.
//! Dropping the future of a wait leaves nothing running.
//!
//! On Apple's platforms and the BSDs, there is no other way to wait. If the kqueue cannot be
//! created, for example because the process is out of descriptors, the spawn fails with that
//! error, as it does if a pipe cannot be created. On Linux, a process that another process traces
//! cannot be collected after it exits until its tracer lets it go. A wait that finds the process in
//! that state continues on the pool described next.
//!
//! The runtime cannot watch for the exit on Android, on Windows, on other unix systems, and on a
//! Linux without pidfd support (before 5.3, or in a sandbox that rejects the call). There, the wait
//! runs as blocking work on a thread of a pool kept for waits for children, and holds that thread
//! until the process exits. The first wait that finds the process still running starts the work.
//! Spawning does not, so a child that nobody waits for holds no thread. Dropping the future of a
//! wait gives up the wait but not the thread. The next wait for the same child takes it up where it
//! left off, so abandoned waits do not pile up threads.
//!
//! The pool is separate from the one behind [`unblock()`](crate::unblock()). Otherwise a program
//! that waits for many long-running children at once would fill that pool, and all its other
//! blocking work would wait behind them. A [dropped child](self#dropping-a-child) is collected on
//! the same pool.
//!
//! # Dropping a child
//!
//! Dropping a [`Child`] closes the pipes it still holds. It leaves the process running, as
//! dropping a std `Child` does. [`Command::kill_on_drop`] kills the process instead.
//!
//! On unix, a process that exits with nobody to collect its status stays a zombie, and std's
//! `Child` leaves it so. By default, a `Child` that is dropped while its process is running hands
//! the process to a thread of the pool for waits for children. That thread waits for the process
//! to exit and collects its status. [`Command::reap_on_drop`] turns this off.
//!
//! Each such thread is held until its process exits, so dropping many long-running children holds
//! as many threads. The pool has room for 500 threads. Beyond that, a dropped child waits for a
//! free thread, and stays a zombie if it exits before one is free. Killing the processes, waiting
//! for them, or turning `reap_on_drop` off keeps threads from being held for long.
//!
//! The threads are named `zruntime child wait`. The pool is separate from the one behind
//! [`unblock()`](crate::unblock()), which all other blocking work shares, including the `fs`
//! module. However many children are dropped, and however long they run, that work never waits
//! behind them.
//!
//! Windows leaves no zombie, so there is nothing to collect there, and `reap_on_drop` does
//! nothing.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Runs a command on a local runtime and checks its output:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(unix)]
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! use zruntime::{LocalRuntime, process::Command};
//!
//! let runtime = LocalRuntime::new()?;
//!
//! let output = runtime.block_on(Command::new("echo").arg("hello").output(&runtime))?;
//!
//! assert!(output.status.success());
//! assert_eq!(output.stdout, b"hello\n");
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(unix))]
//! # fn main() {}
