//! The two flavours a runtime comes in, and what each builds its shared state from.
//!
//! A runtime's state is reached from several places at once: every handle on it, every task
//! handle, timer and registration, and the thread driving it. What those places share it through
//! is the only thing that tells the two flavours apart. A [`Local`] runtime shares it through
//! [`Rc`] and [`RefCell`], and so never leaves the thread it was made on; a [`Shared`] one shares
//! it through [`Arc`] and [`Mutex`], and may be handed to, and driven from, any thread. Everything
//! else — the scheduler, the reactor, the loop that drives them — is written once, over [`Mode`],
//! and reaches that state through the associated types of the sealed trait behind it.
//!
//! The one other difference is who may drive a runtime. A shared runtime that came out of one of
//! the registries the `helper` feature keeps has a seat, which a helper thread takes where no
//! thread is inside `block_on` on it; the sealed trait's two hooks, for `block_on` and for work
//! just handed over, are where a shared runtime looks for that seat and a local one never does.
//!
//! Each flavour also keeps, for every thread, a record of the runtime of its flavour that thread
//! drives, which is where the free `spawn` and `spawn_local` find the runtime to put a task on.
//! The record is the sealed trait's too, so that each flavour has a thread-local of its own to
//! hold it in: a pointer to a local runtime's state is not the type of one to a shared runtime's.
//!
//! Neither flavour is `Send` or `Sync` by assertion: a `Local` runtime is neither because an `Rc`
//! is neither, and a `Shared` one is both because every piece of it is.
