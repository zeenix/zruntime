/// A UDP socket, to send datagrams from and receive datagrams on.
///
/// Create a socket with [`UdpSocket::bind`]. It receives the datagrams sent to its address.
/// [`send_to`](UdpSocket::send_to) sends a datagram to any address, and
/// [`recv_from`](UdpSocket::recv_from) receives one together with the address it came from.
///
/// A socket can be [connected](UdpSocket::connect) to a peer. Then [`send`](UdpSocket::send) sends
/// to that peer with no address to pass, and the socket receives only the datagrams that peer
/// sends. [`recv`](UdpSocket::recv) returns a datagram without the address it came from.
///
/// A datagram is one message, sent and received whole. Addresses are socket addresses, never host
/// names; see [`UdpSocket::bind`]. The socket is the async counterpart of [`std::net::UdpSocket`]:
/// an operation that has to wait lets other tasks run instead of blocking the thread.
///
/// The socket runs on the runtime passed to its constructor. Its type carries that runtime's
/// flavour, as the [module documentation](super) explains: a `UdpSocket<Local>` (the default) stays
/// on the thread that made it, and a `UdpSocket<Shared>` can be sent to and used from any thread.
///
/// Any number of tasks can wait to receive (with `recv`, `recv_from`, `peek` or `peek_from`) or to
/// send (with `send` or `send_to`) at once, each through a reference to the socket. Each receive
/// takes a datagram of its own, so tasks that receive together get one each. A peek leaves the
/// datagram on the socket for the next receive.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Two sockets: one sends a greeting to the other, which receives it together with the address it
/// came from.
///
/// ```
/// use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

/// runtime.block_on(async {
///     sender.send_to(b"hello", receiver.local_addr()?).await?;
///
///     let mut greeting = [0; 16];
