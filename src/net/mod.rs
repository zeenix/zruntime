//! Async sockets on a [`Runtime`].
//!
//! The module has TCP sockets (`TcpListener` and `TcpStream`), a UDP socket (`UdpSocket`) and, on
//! unix platforms, unix-domain sockets in the `unix` module (`UnixListener`, `UnixStream` and
//! `UnixDatagram`). The families are behind the `tcp`, `udp` and `unix` cargo features, none on by
//! default.
//!
//! # The runtime
//!
//! A socket is created on a runtime. Its constructor takes the runtime as the first argument, and
//! the runtime's reactor watches the socket from then on.
//!
//! The socket's operations make progress while a thread is running [`Runtime::block_on`] on that
//! runtime. A runtime from `SharedRuntime::current` also has a helper thread, which drives the
//! runtime when no thread is running `block_on` on it.
//!
//! The socket's type carries the flavour of its runtime. A socket made on a [`LocalRuntime`] is,
//! for example, a `TcpStream<Local>` (`Local` is the default). It stays on the thread that made it.
//! A socket made on a [`SharedRuntime`] is a `TcpStream<Shared>`. It can be sent to and used from
//! any thread.
//!
//! # Operations
//!
//! Sockets are in non-blocking mode. When an operation would block, the task waits until the
//! runtime reports the socket ready, and other tasks run on the thread in the meantime. Connecting
//! is such an operation too, so `connect` never blocks the thread.
//!
//! TCP and UDP sockets are bound or connected to a socket address, never to a host name. Looking up
//! a name, for example with std's `ToSocketAddrs`, blocks the thread until the resolver answers,
//! and a task must not do that. To connect to a host name, look it up on another thread (for
//! example with `unblock`), then try the addresses it returns in turn.
//!
//! `TcpStream` and `UnixStream` implement the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits of
//! [`futures-io`], so the extension traits of [`futures`] work on them. A shared reference to a
//! stream implements the traits too, so a reader and a writer can share one stream. Closing a
//! stream shuts down its write half, and the peer then reads the end of the stream.
//!
//! # Several tasks on one socket
//!
//! Any number of tasks can wait in the async methods of one socket at once, through shared
//! references. These are the methods that accept, peek, receive or send, in either direction. When
//! the socket becomes ready, the waiting tasks wake. A task that finds another task took the data
//! first waits again.
//!
//! Two paths allow only one waiting task per direction: the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`
//! implementations of a stream, and the `Incoming` stream of a listener. If a second task waits in
//! the same direction through one of them, it replaces the first, which is then never woken. Tasks
//! that share a direction there must take turns, for example behind a lock. A task waiting in an
//! async method never replaces a task waiting through one of these paths, nor the other way round.
//!
//! # Limits on Windows
//!
//! On Windows, a runtime watches at most 1023 sockets at a time. A server there can hold at most
//! that many sockets on one runtime, its listener included.
