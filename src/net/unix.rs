//! Unix-domain sockets, on unix platforms only.
//!
//! This module has [`UnixListener`], [`UnixStream`] and [`UnixDatagram`], and the [`Incoming`]
//! stream of the connections a listener accepts.
//!
//! A unix-domain socket is named by a path in the file system. Binding a listener or a datagram
//! socket to a path creates a socket file there. A stream connects to a listener, and a datagram
//! socket sends to another, by the path the target is bound to.
//!
//! Nothing removes the socket file when the socket is dropped, so remove it when you are done with
//! the socket. Binding to a path that already has a file fails with
//! [`AddrInUse`](std::io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse). The system limits the length of a path to about a
//! hundred bytes. A longer path fails with [`InvalidInput`](std::io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput).
//!
//! On Linux and Android a socket can also be named in the abstract namespace, by a string of bytes
//! that has no file behind it. std's `SocketAddrExt` creates and reads such names, and
//! [`UnixStream::connect_addr`] connects to one.
//!
//! The sockets run on a runtime like the sockets of the [parent module](super). Its documentation
//! explains which threads drive a socket's operations, how a socket's type carries its runtime's
//! flavour, and how many tasks can wait on one socket at once.

/// A unix-domain socket server, listening for connections.
///
/// Create a listener with [`UnixListener::bind`]. Then call [`accept`](UnixListener::accept) to
/// take one connection, or [`incoming`](UnixListener::incoming) for a stream of connections. Each
/// connection is a [`UnixStream`]. The listener is the async counterpart of
/// [`std::os::unix::net::UnixListener`]: waiting for a connection lets other tasks run instead of
/// blocking the thread.
///
/// The listener runs on the runtime passed to its constructor, and so do the streams it accepts.
/// Its type carries that runtime's flavour, as the [module documentation](super) explains: a
/// `UnixListener<Local>` (the default) stays on the thread that made it, and a
/// `UnixListener<Shared>` can be sent to and used from any thread.

/// Any number of tasks can wait in [`accept`](UnixListener::accept) at once through a reference to
/// the listener, and each connection goes to one of them. Only one task at a time can wait for the
/// next item of an [`Incoming`] stream, counting all the streams of the listener. Tasks waiting in
/// `accept` do not count.

/// * [`pair`](UnixDatagram::pair) creates two sockets that are connected to each other.
///
/// [`send_to`] sends a datagram to the socket bound to a path. [`connect`] fixes the one socket to
/// send to and receive from, which [`send`] and [`recv`] then use. A datagram keeps its boundaries:
/// one receive takes one datagram, and what does not fit into the buffer is discarded.
///
/// The socket runs on the runtime passed to its constructor. Its type carries that runtime's
/// flavour, as the [module documentation](super) explains: a `UnixDatagram<Local>` (the default)
/// stays on the thread that made it, and a `UnixDatagram<Shared>` can be sent to and used from any
/// thread.
///
/// Any number of tasks can wait to receive at once, with [`recv`](UnixDatagram::recv) or
/// [`recv_from`](UnixDatagram::recv_from), and any number can wait to send, with
/// [`send`](UnixDatagram::send) or [`send_to`](UnixDatagram::send_to), each through a reference to
/// the socket. Each receive takes a datagram of its own, so tasks that receive together get one
/// each.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A pair of datagram sockets: one sends a datagram and the other receives it, then the answer goes
/// the other way.
