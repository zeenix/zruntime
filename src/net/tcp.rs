/// A stream of the connections a [`TcpListener`] accepts, created by [`TcpListener::incoming`].
///
/// Each item is the [`TcpStream`] of a connection, on the listener's runtime, or the error of a
/// failed accept. The stream never ends. It is pending while no connection waits, and yields the
/// next connection when it arrives. It implements the [`Stream`] trait of [`futures-core`], so the
/// extension traits of [`futures`] work on it.
///
/// An error does not end the stream, and the stream does not stay pending until the next connection
/// arrives: polled again, it accepts again. The errors are those of
/// [`accept`](TcpListener::accept), which also describes what they leave behind. Some leave the
/// connection queued, so the next item is the same error at once. A loop that keeps taking items
/// after an error then spins the thread, so back off first, for example with [`Runtime::sleep`].
///
/// Only one task at a time can wait for the next item, counting every `Incoming` of the listener.
/// If a second task waits as well, it replaces the first, which is then never woken. Tasks that
/// take items from one listener's streams must take turns, for example behind a lock. Tasks waiting
/// in [`accept`](TcpListener::accept) do not count against this limit, nor the other way round.
