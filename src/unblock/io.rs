/// An async adapter for a blocking I/O handle.
///
/// Each operation on the handle runs as blocking work through [`unblock()`], so the handle never
/// blocks the thread that polls a task.
///
/// The handle can be anything that implements [`Read`], [`Write`], [`Seek`] or [`Iterator`]: a
/// file, the standard input or output, a pipe to a child process, or the entries of a directory. If
/// the handle is `Send + 'static`, the adapter implements:
///
/// * [`AsyncRead`] of `futures-io`, if the handle implements [`Read`].
/// * [`AsyncWrite`] of `futures-io`, if it implements [`Write`].
/// * [`AsyncSeek`] of `futures-io`, if it implements [`Seek`].
/// * [`Stream`] of `futures-core`, if it is an [`Iterator`] whose items are `Send + 'static`.
///
/// Like [`unblock()`], the adapter needs no runtime and works under any executor. It is `Send` and
/// `Sync` if the handle is `Send`, and it is always `Unpin`.
///
/// # One operation at a time
///
/// The adapter runs one operation on the handle at a time. Each operation waits for the one in
/// progress to finish, whether that is a read, a write or anything else. A read that is served from
/// bytes already read ahead does not wait.
///
/// Two tasks can wait at once, for example the two halves of a split adapter. Both are woken when
/// the operation ends, even if one of the wakers panics.
///
/// This is harmless for a file. It can deadlock a handle with separate read and write streams, such
/// as a socket or a serial port. A read that waits for the peer to send data blocks a write that
/// the peer is waiting for first.
///
/// # Reading
///
/// A read from the handle reads up to the adapter's capacity, whatever the size of the buffer it
/// was given. The bytes the buffer does not take are kept for the reads that follow. So the
/// handle's own position is ahead of what the reads have returned.
///
/// A seek accounts for this, including a seek from [`SeekFrom::Current`]. A write does not. If the
/// handle's reads and writes share one position, as a file's do, seek to `SeekFrom::Current(0)`
/// before writing after a read. That moves the handle's position back to where the reads got to.
///
/// The bytes read ahead are kept across writes. A handle with two separate streams loses none of
/// the bytes it read.
///
/// # Writing
///
/// A write takes as many of the given bytes as the capacity allows. It completes as soon as it has
/// passed them to blocking work, which writes all of them to the handle. The next operation waits
/// for that work to finish. If the work failed, the next write or flush returns the error.
///
/// A flush waits for the earlier writes to finish, then flushes the handle. Closing the adapter
/// flushes it but leaves the handle open. The handle is closed when it is dropped, either with the
/// adapter or after [`into_inner`](Unblock::into_inner).
///
/// Once a write completes, its bytes no longer depend on the adapter. Dropping the adapter gives up
/// the wait for the write in progress, not the write itself. The bytes are still written, as for
/// [`unblock()`], but an error goes unreported. Flush the adapter before dropping it to learn of
/// errors.
///
/// # Iterating
///
/// The stream pulls items from the iterator in batches, in one piece of blocking work, and yields
/// them one at a time. A batch holds as many items as the capacity, but at most 16, or fewer if the
/// iterator ends first.
///
/// The first item of a batch is therefore delayed until the whole batch has been pulled. This
/// matters for iterators with slow items, such as the lines of the standard input. With a capacity
/// of 1, each item is yielded as soon as it arrives.
///
/// The stream yields `None` when the iterator ends. If it is polled again after that, it pulls from
/// the iterator again.
///
/// # Using the handle directly
///
/// [`get_mut`](Unblock::get_mut), [`with_mut`](Unblock::with_mut) and
/// [`into_inner`](Unblock::into_inner) give access to the handle itself, once the operation in
/// progress has finished. They drop the bytes read ahead and the items pulled ahead. These are
/// lost: the handle is already past them, and the adapter cannot know what is done to the handle
/// directly.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// If an operation on the handle panics, the poll that waits for it raises the panic again with its
/// original payload, as for [`unblock()`]. The handle is lost with the panic, and any later use of
/// the adapter panics too.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A [`Cursor`](std::io::Cursor) stands in for a blocking handle to read, and a `Vec` for one to
/// write. The examples drive the futures with `block_on` from the `futures` crate, but the
/// `block_on` of any executor works, as the adapter needs no runtime:
///
/// ```
/// use std::io::Cursor;
///
/// use futures::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt, executor::block_on};
/// use zruntime::Unblock;
///
/// block_on(async {
///     let mut reader = Unblock::new(Cursor::new("hello, world"));
///     let mut text = String::new();
///     reader.read_to_string(&mut text).await?;
///     assert_eq!(text, "hello, world");
///
///     let mut writer = Unblock::new(Vec::new());
///     writer.write_all(b"goodbye").await?;
///     writer.flush().await?;
///     assert_eq!(writer.into_inner().await, b"goodbye");
///
///     std::io::Result::Ok(())
/// })
/// .unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Reading the standard input line by line, as the lines arrive, through a `BufReader` and `lines`
/// from the `futures` crate. A `Cursor` stands in for `std::io::stdin()`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::io::Cursor;
///

/// use zruntime::Unblock;

/// block_on(async {
///     let stdin = Cursor::new("first line\nsecond line\n");
