//! Blocking work on a pool of threads, and [`Unblock`], an adapter for blocking I/O handles.

/// Runs `work` on a thread of a pool kept for blocking work, and returns a future of its result.
///
/// Use it for work that blocks, such as a file read, a host-name lookup or a call into a library
/// with no async form. If such work runs on the thread that polls tasks, it holds up every other
/// task on that thread. Here it holds up only the pool thread that runs it. The task that awaits
/// the future is woken when the work is done.
///
/// The work is submitted to the pool before `unblock` returns, not when the future is first polled.
/// An idle pool thread takes it. If none is idle, a new thread is started, up to a limit of 500
/// threads. Beyond that, the work waits in a queue, in submission order, until a thread is free.
///
/// Pool threads are named `zruntime blocking work`. A thread is reused for later work. It exits
/// after ten seconds with nothing to run, so an unused pool holds no threads.
///
/// Work that never ends holds its thread forever. If every pool thread is held that way, later work
/// waits forever too. The pool suits work that ends on its own. For work that waits on other pool
/// work, or that runs as long as the program does, use [`std::thread::spawn`] instead.
///
/// The work runs to the end whether or not the future is polled, and even if the future is dropped.
/// Dropping the future gives up the wait for the result. It cannot cancel the work, or remove it
/// from the queue before it starts. Nothing waits for the pool threads, so work that is still
/// running or queued when the process exits is lost.
///
/// The returned future needs no runtime. It wakes the waker from its most recent poll, so it can be
/// awaited under any executor, from a task on any thread.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// If `work` panics, the panic is caught on the pool thread, which carries on with other work. The
/// poll that would have returned the value raises the panic again, with its original payload. A
/// future that is dropped before that poll never sees the panic. The panic hook runs once, when the
/// panic happens, and not again when the panic is raised again.
///
/// `unblock` itself panics if the pool has no thread and cannot start one for the work, as
/// [`std::thread::spawn`] does when it fails. If the pool has threads, the work waits for one of
/// them instead.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A sleep stands in for blocking work. The example drives the future with `block_on` from the
/// `futures` crate, but the `block_on` of any executor works, as `unblock` needs no runtime:
///
/// ```
/// use std::{thread, time::Duration};
///
/// use futures::executor::block_on;
/// use zruntime::unblock;
///
/// let answer = unblock(|| {
///     thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
///     42
/// });
///
/// assert_eq!(block_on(answer), 42);
