//! [`OpenOptions`], a builder for opening files.

use std::{future::Future, io, path::Path};

use super::{File, sealed::Sealed};
use crate::unblock;

/// A builder for opening a file: for reading, writing or both, and for what to do if the file does
/// or does not exist.
///
/// Set the options on the builder, then call [`open`](OpenOptions::open) to open a file with them.
/// A builder can open any number of files. It wraps [`std::fs::OpenOptions`], with the same
/// defaults and the same combinations that make an open fail.
///
/// On unix, the `OpenOptionsExt` trait of the `unix` module adds the permission bits of a new file
/// and custom open flags. On Windows, the trait of that name in the `windows` module adds options
/// such as the access mode, the share mode and the attributes.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A file opened for appending gets every write at its end, whatever its position is:
///
/// ```
/// use futures::{AsyncWriteExt, executor::block_on};
/// use zruntime::fs::{self, OpenOptions};
///
/// # let pid = std::process::id();
/// # let dir = std::env::temp_dir().join(format!("zruntime-fs-doc-open-options-{pid}"));
/// # std::fs::create_dir_all(&dir).unwrap();
/// block_on(async {
///     let path = dir.join("log.txt");
///     fs::write(&path, "first\n").await?;
///
///     let mut log = OpenOptions::new().append(true).open(&path).await?;
///     log.write_all(b"second\n").await?;
///     log.flush().await?;
///
///     assert_eq!(fs::read_to_string(&path).await?, "first\nsecond\n");
///
///     std::io::Result::Ok(())
/// })
/// .unwrap();
/// # std::fs::remove_dir_all(&dir).unwrap();
/// ```
