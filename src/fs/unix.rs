//! Unix-specific extensions to [`fs`](super).

//! The extension traits add to the builders and the entries of the parent module what the traits of
//! the same names in [`std::os::unix::fs`] add to those of std. Import the trait, then call its
//! methods on the builder or the entry. [`Metadata`](super::Metadata),
//! [`Permissions`](super::Permissions) and [`FileType`](super::FileType) are the types of std, so
//! the traits of std that extend them are re-exported here.
