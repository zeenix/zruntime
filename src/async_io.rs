/// An async I/O handle: a source that the runtime watches for readiness. Like `smol::Async`.
///
/// It runs I/O on the source without blocking the thread. An operation that would block waits for
/// the runtime to report the source ready instead, and the thread runs other tasks in the meantime.
///
/// On unix, the source can be anything with a file descriptor: a pipe, a terminal, an eventfd, an
/// inotify instance, the standard I/O of a child process, or a socket type that the `net` module
/// does not cover. On Windows, it can only be a socket, because that is all the runtime's `select`
/// can watch there. [`readable`](AsyncIo::readable) and [`writable`](AsyncIo::writable) only wait
/// for readiness, for a descriptor that another library does the I/O on.
///
/// The handle uses the runtime passed to its constructor, which watches the source from then on.
/// Its operations make progress while a thread is running [`Runtime::block_on`] on that runtime,
/// or, on a runtime from `SharedRuntime::current`, while the helper thread runs it. The type
/// carries the flavour of the runtime:
///
/// * On a [`LocalRuntime`](crate::LocalRuntime), it is an `AsyncIo<T, Local>` ([`Local`] is the
///   default), and stays on the thread that created it.
/// * On a [`SharedRuntime`](crate::SharedRuntime), it is an `AsyncIo<T, Shared>`, which can be sent
///   to and used from any thread. A shared runtime only watches a source that is `Send` and `Sync`,
///   as [`Source`] says.
///
/// # Waiting
///
/// Any number of tasks can wait at once, in either direction, through
/// [`readable`](AsyncIo::readable), [`writable`](AsyncIo::writable),
/// [`read_with`](AsyncIo::read_with) and [`write_with`](AsyncIo::write_with). Each needs only a
/// shared reference to the handle.
///
/// [`poll_read_with`](AsyncIo::poll_read_with), [`poll_write_with`](AsyncIo::poll_write_with), and
/// the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` impls built on them, keep only one waiting task per direction.
/// If a second task waits to read through them, for example, it replaces the first one, which is
/// then never woken. Tasks that share a direction through them must take turns, for example behind
/// a lock.
///
/// # I/O traits
///
/// `AsyncIo<T, M>` and `&AsyncIo<T, M>` implement the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits of
/// [`futures-io`], so the extension traits of [`futures`] work with them. The impls for a shared
/// reference let a reader and a writer share one handle. `AsyncRead` needs `&T` to implement
/// `Read`, and `AsyncWrite` needs `&T` to implement `Write`. That is the case for
/// `std::io::PipeReader` and `PipeWriter`, and for std's stream sockets, `TcpStream` and
/// `UnixStream`. Listeners and datagram sockets implement neither.
///
/// The runtime's reactor shares the source, so the handle never gives out a `&mut T`. A type that
/// only implements `Read` or `Write` for `&mut self`, such as `std::process::ChildStdout` and
/// `ChildStdin`, must be converted first. On unix, convert it through `OwnedFd`: a `ChildStdout`
/// into a `PipeReader`, and a `ChildStdin` into a `PipeWriter`. The pipes of children spawned with
/// `zruntime::process` are async already.
///
/// # Regular files
///
/// `AsyncIo` is not for regular files. On Linux and Android, the runtime cannot watch one, so
/// waiting on one fails. Elsewhere, a regular file is always reported ready, and reading it blocks
/// the thread, whatever its mode. `zruntime::Unblock` and `zruntime::fs` run each operation on a
/// pool of threads instead.
///
/// # Example
///
/// The reading end of a pipe, read to its end while a thread writes to the other end:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(unix)]
/// # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
/// use std::{io::Write, thread};
///
/// use futures::AsyncReadExt;
/// use zruntime::{AsyncIo, LocalRuntime};
///
/// let runtime = LocalRuntime::new()?;
/// let (reader, mut writer) = std::io::pipe()?;
/// // The reading end is switched to non-blocking mode, and watched by the runtime from here on.
/// let mut reader = AsyncIo::new(&runtime, reader)?;
///
/// // The writer is dropped as the thread ends, which is the end of what the reader reads.
/// let writing = thread::spawn(move || writer.write_all(b"hello"));
///
/// let mut message = Vec::new();
/// runtime.block_on(reader.read_to_end(&mut message))?;
/// writing.join().expect("the writer does not panic")?;
///
/// assert_eq!(message, b"hello");
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// # #[cfg(not(unix))]
