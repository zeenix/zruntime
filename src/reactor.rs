//! What watches a runtime's sockets and keeps its timers.
//!
//! A reactor holds every source registered on it and every timer taken from it, and the thread
//! driving the runtime hands it that thread through [`Reactor::wait`]: one wait on the platform's
//! poller, bounded by the nearest deadline, and then the wakes for whatever that wait found ready
//! and for whatever timer has come due.
//!
//! The poller watches each source in the directions the reactor last told it to, and is told of a
//! change rather than handed every source on each wait, so that a wait costs what the sources
//! found ready cost and no more, where the platform's poller allows. The poll is level-triggered:
//! a source watched in a direction it is ready in is reported by every wait until it is not. A
//! direction is watched from the moment somebody waits in it: the waiter that stores the first
//! waker of a direction has the poller told there and then, and breaks the wait under way where
//! the platform's poller sees the change only in the wait after it. A direction nobody waits in
//! any more is let go of later, before the next wait, and only where nobody has come back to wait
//! in it again by then: a task woken by readiness usually stores its waker again as it runs out
//! of what to read, and that costs the poller nothing. A source a wait found ready, or one a
//! waiter gave up on, is listed for that look before the next wait.
//!
//! Two locks guard the sources and the timers, and neither is taken while the other is held. A
//! source's wakers live in its entry in the map, under the map's lock, and every change the poller
//! is told of is made under that lock too, so that two of them never reach it out of order. Neither
//! lock is held across the wait, which may last until a deadline, nor across a wake or the drop of
//! a waker or of the last clone of a source, each of which runs somebody else's code and may come
//! straight back here to register a source, to ask for a timer or to let either go. The flag that
//! spares a `notify` its write while a wake-up is on its way needs no lock: it is an atomic of the
//! runtime's remote.
